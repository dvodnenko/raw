### Tags

Execute ...

* ```raw tags``` to see al of your tags
* ```raw tags --new (tag name)``` to create a new tag...
* ... or ```raw tags --new (comma-separated tags titles)``` to create many tags at one moment

### Sessions

* ```raw begin -t [comma-separated tags titles] -m "[message]" ``` to begin a new session
* ```raw stop``` to finish the session
* ```raw sessions``` - shows all of the finished sessions **on the provided date range...**

### How to provide the date range ?

there are two options for the ```raw sessions``` command:
* --dr
* --lxd
you **must** provide on of them (but not both!)

#### --dr option

```--dr``` means "dates range". you must provide regular dates range in this pattern:
~~~
(start year)-(start month)-(start day)..(end year)-(end month)-(end day)
~~~
end information is **not** required. if you do not provide it (just "(start).." ) - ``raw`` will automatically set today as the end date.

you can also provide such values as `today` & `all` to the `--dr` option, where `today` means "all the sessions that were started today
AND are finished"

#### --lxd option

```--lxd``` option just means "last X days". so if you execute ```raw sessions --lxd 7``` 
it will output all the sessions for last 7 days (because "last 7 days"). also, lxd option should be grater 
than zero (because you cannot see information about "last 0 days"). ```--lxd 1``` means "today" (same as ```--dr today```)
